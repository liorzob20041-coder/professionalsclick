Website Project Brief

Project Name: ProfessionalsClick (בעלי מקצוע בקליק)

General Idea:
This website is a professional marketplace that connects customers with local tradespeople and service providers (plumbers, electricians, renovators, etc.). The goal is to make it easy for users to find a professional, see detailed information, compare, and contact them directly.

Main Features

Homepage

Hero section with search bar (search by profession and area).

Highlight of main service categories (e.g., electricity, plumbing, renovations).

Marketing text: why choose us, benefits, trust, transparency.

Call-to-action buttons leading to professional listings.

Professionals Listing Page

Display cards for each professional.

Each card shows:

Name / Company name

Profile image or video

Years of experience

Short description of services

Average rating + number of reviews

Request Form Page

A form where users can describe their need and request offers.

Option to upload an image or file (optional).

Requests are stored in the system and forwarded to relevant professionals.

Price Estimator (optional, later)

Q&A style form to estimate service cost.

User selects category → subcategory → describes the issue → receives a price range.

Technical Requirements

Languages: Hebrew (main), English, Russian (translations ready).

Framework: Python Flask backend (already set up).

Canonical tags, hreflang for languages

Structured data (JSON-LD) for businesses and reviews

Design Guidelines

Professional and modern look.

Brand colors: Orange #f2994a, Accent #c94d18.

Responsive: works perfectly on desktop and mobile.

Cards with soft shadows, rounded corners.

Icons (SVG, consistent style) instead of emojis.

Hebrew RTL alignment with clean typography.

What I Expect from You

Build the HTML/CSS/JS for all pages (homepage, listing, profile, form).

Ensure mobile-first responsive design.

Integrate the templates with Flask routes.

Use placeholders for data (professionals, reviews, etc.) — I will connect the real JSON later.

Make sure design looks polished and professional, comparable to leading competitors.
